#scripts
This repo contains scripts that I've found useful over the years

## ChromeApp
Creates an app using google chrome with it's own profile, great alternative to fluid as it enables extensions.
``` 
    1.  ./ChromeApp.sh
    2.  Enter app name
    3.  Enter url
    4.  Enter icon full path
```

## h_from_cpp
Generates header files from cpp files
```
    1.  Move script to directory of .cpp files
    2.  ./h_from_cpp.sh
```
You can also run it with it's full path, without moving the script.

## rm_perm
Removes password from pdf
```
    1.  Move script to directory of .pdf files
    2.  ./rm_perm.sh FILENAME.pdf
```
You can also run it with it's full path, without moving the script.
